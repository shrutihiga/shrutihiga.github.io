            <center><h3>Mentors:</h3>Ismael Arroyo, Andreuibanez</center>
            <center><h3>Description:</h3>The aim this project is to develop a system that, making use of the Liquid Galaxy capacity to display information over an interactive map obtained from a big data analytics and mining process. Firstly, the data will be gathered from public data APIs and stored in a database to be processed later. This information will be related to historical weather conditions, water and energy reservoirs, earthquakes and other weather related information. Secondly, the data will be analysed under some kind of data analysis algorithm such clustering with K-Means algorithm or Regression Models making use of a Spark Uni-Node System running on the cloud and Python ( pySpark library). The conclusions obtained from this data analysis will be shown on a external interface, such a website running in a server connected to the Liquid Galaxy. This website will offer to the end-user, the possibility to seamlessly display the chosen information into Liquid Galaxy. Then the system will automatically send the corresponding KML files to Liquid Galaxy in order to display this information in a descriptive and visual way, for example percentual polygons, polylines, etc.</center>

            <center><h3>Description:</h3>SAVT will be a software engine to visualize data of crop fields to Liquid Galaxy, allowing you to track his state. This image data, collected by drones, planes or satellites, can be among others : vegetation map, vigor map, nitrogen map, irrigation sectors, dose of fertilizer and variability map. We plan to have access also to data collected by drone, and by different IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, with sensor arrays on the crop field. We'll also use the platform to visualize this data overlaid on the maps and with explanations in almost real time, such as temperature, hygrometry, wind, and others upon availability. The management interface will have the ability to show the analyzed data from a specific client, land or area. Likewise, it will also be possible to collect data from various sources and import images with their coordinates to show them to Liquid Galaxy where each crop field will show a pop-up balloon with all the information about it. Another functionality is the system integration with google assistant using actions SDK to make voice requests and having a conversational UI experience.</center>

            <center><h3>Description:</h3>Mainly the project has the purpose of showing some data in Liquid Galaxy (different options to choose by the user). The presentation will be so visual in the Liquid Galaxy monitors, and the information will be represented in a bubble and different shapes. There will also be the possibility to make a tour according to which is the chosen option. There will be many options, and the user interaction will be so funny and interesting. The point of communication between the user and the application will be necessary to develop a fluid interface. This interface will handle the connection with the API to obtain the data (SPARQL queries), then the treatment of data and classifying them according to the type, and at last sending to the Liquid Galaxy (KML file) to visualize the data in a map point. An important point is to know the data to be treated from the Wikimedia API. The data will have to be processed and save the values that will be useful. There are different use cases and according to these, we will work with some types of data or with others. At the end, the important is that the Liquid Galaxy visualization of the data will be simple and so the user obtains what he has requested.</center>

For example, Baidu.co and Tencent,co cover different street view areas, therefore we can merge Baidu's APIs into this project.

            <center><h3>Description:</h3>I'm focused on the computer vision & computer graph in Chinese Academy of Sciences. At the same time I work with a team about 3D Urban Scene Modeling and street view in Shenzhen. My GSoC project is to make the Liquid Galaxy views synchronised with JavaScript ,a js library which can control the slave camera just as the google earth client(which we always set the yawoffset in drive.ini).Surely some websockets are needed . Later We'd get this to some other web application.Maybe ShenZhen(a city of China) street view application. If anyone who are interested in this project and have some ideas about the project.Welcome to chat with me.Hope to be your friend and share with you!</center>

            <center><h3>Description:</h3>Using Microsoft Kinect, the gesture and voice recognition features will be used to control the Liquid Galaxy navigation around the Google Earth Map to create a more interactive user experience. This will involve using voice to search for locations and get directions to them and using gestures to move the map around and zoom.</center>

        <center><h3>Author:</h3>Reese Butler</center>
            <center><h3>Year:</h3>2011</center>
            <center><h3>Description:</h3>Currently, the most popular method of controlling Liquid Galaxy setups is through the use of a Space Navigator (produced by 3Dconnexion) and a touchscreen. My project aims to improve Liquid Galaxy’s accessibility by adding Android phones to the list of input devices. Since many people own Android phones already, this project would effectively eliminate the need to purchase additional peripherals in order to control a Liquid Galaxy setup.</center>

        <center><h3>Author:</h3>Ben Wright</center>
            <center><h3>Year:</h3>2011</center>
            <center><h3>Description:</h3>Adding Network Sync support to the open source 3D graphics engine Irrlicht for use with the liquid-galaxy project. This involves synchronizing a game state across multiple computers in real time (at least 30 times a second) to produce a seamless gaming experience on a liquid galaxy computer. With the hundreds of applications currently developed with Irrlicht and its ease of use it is a perfect engine to support the liquid galaxy experience with potential for some really cool apps down the line.</center>
